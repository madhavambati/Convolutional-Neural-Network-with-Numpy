An **Optical and Handwritten digit recogniser**. A Convolution Neural Network trained over MNIST data set. 

A **Deep learning Model** made from scratch with only numpy. No other libraries/frameworks were used. This allowed me to deeply understand every method in my model and gave me the intution of Neural Networks.

## About MNIST dataset
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from [this page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
